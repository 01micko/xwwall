.SH NAME
xwwall \- Xwwall
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBxwwall\fP [options]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBxwwall\fP is a graphical wallpaper setter for the X Window System
often known as \fBX11\fP and \fBWayland\fP desktops for Linux and other
*nix distributions. It should run in light weight desktop environments
like Openbox, fluxbox, JWM for X11 and Labwc, Sway and others for
Wayland. It supports up to 6 monitors. It is a shell script written
in \fBbash\fP\&.
It requires \fBGtk3dialog\fP for the graphical user interface which is
a gtk+\-3.0 based UI program that describes dialog boxes from a shell
script.
In X11 it utilises \fBfeh\fP as the engine to set the wallpaper and
\fBxrandr\fP to get screen dimensions and placement of monitors.
In Wayland it uses \fBswaybg\fP to set wallpapers and \fBwlr\-randr\fP for
screen dimensions and placement.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
\fBxwwall\fP can be invoked with the following options.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h | \-\-help
show help and exit.
.TP
.B \-v | \-\-version
print version and exit.
.TP
.B \-d|\-\-delconf
delete the user configuration file \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/xwwall.conf\fP
in case it gets messed up from manual intervention.
.TP
.B \-\-restore [ optional arg ]

.sp
\fB\-\-restore\fP takes an optional \fBprofile\fP argument.
See \fBAdvanced Startup\fP further below.
.UNINDENT
.SH USAGE
.sp
Normally, \fBxwwall\fP is started from a menu entry without any options
although you could start it from a keyboard shortcut.
.SS Main GUI
.sp
The first thing you may see is a splash window warning you if you
have too many wallpapers and cuts off at a 250 limit and then a
window opens showing your wallpapers. Just select one and it will
open in a \fBSub GUI\fP window; select the image by pressing it or \fBno\fP
to reject.
You can also select if you want the image to strecth, center, tile or fit
your screen. If you do select \fBno\fP the program goes back to the main
window.
If you have more than 1 monitor the program cycles through those so you can
choose different backgrounds for each of them.
Once done a confirmation window opens and you can either press \fBYes\fP,
\fBRefresh\fP or \fBNo\fP; \fBYes\fP sets your wallpaper(s) while \fBNo\fP exits
the program. \fBRefresh\fP restarts the program so you can try again.
You can exit the program safely at any stage via \fBCancel\fP or
the \fBX\fP (close) button of your window manager or compositor.
.SS Sub GUI
.sp
This pops up after your selection in \fBMain GUI\fP and if on a single monitor
sets the background directly or otherwise cycles through your outputs
and the pops the \fBConfirm GUI\fP at the end.
.SS Preferences
.sp
There is a \fBPreferences\fP button in the bottom left of the main window
to set the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Background directory \- any directory where you have read access
.IP 2. 3
Optional extra directories for wallpaper search.
If extra directories are enabled a preference checkbox is shown
so that the user can switch between the main background directory or
the configured extra background directories. Up to 3 extra directories
are allowed. Checked enables extras, unchecked for the default.
.IP 3. 3
Splash checkbox screen for multiple monitors only:
checked to show, unchecked to hide.
.IP 4. 3
Slight adjustments to width of the main interface.
.IP 5. 3
A background color for centered or transparent images.
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration
.sp
The config files are stored in \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/\fP directory.
Here the main configuration is stored from \fIPreferences\fP and if using
\fIwayland\fP the \fBcmd\fP file which is sourced at startup with the
\fB\-\-restore\fP option in your startup configuration. On \fIX11\fP the \fBfeh\fP
program generates a \fB$HOME/.fehbg\fP executable file which is executed
at startup  with the \fB\-\-restore\fP option if configured in your startup
configuration.
.sp
Extra background directories are stored in a \fBbash array\fP in the config
file from the \fBPreferences\fP interface.
.SS Startup
.sp
You can start the program to restore your background choices from
your \fBautostart\fP or similar file with the following:
.sp
\fBxwwall \-\-restore\fP
.sp
Consult your window manager or compositor documentation for the
correct procedure.
.SS Advanced Startup
.sp
\fBxwwall\fP supports \fIprofiles\fP such that you can have separate profile
directories under the \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/\fP directory. This is
useful if you have different graphical environments setup so that you
can have different wallpapers in different sessions. For example, you
may have \fBlabwc\fP and \fBopenbox\fP on your system. You can create
separate profiles for each of these, and as many as you want, named
whatever you want. \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/labwc/\fP profile directory
for \fIlabwc\fP and \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/openbox/\fP profile directory
for \fIopenbox\fP\&.
.sp
Since \fIlabwc\fP is a \fIwayland\fP compositor then to make the profile useful
you copy the \fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/cmd\fP file to
\fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/labwc/cmd\fP
.sp
And since \fIopenbox\fP is an \fIX11\fP window manager the approach is slightly
different. You need to copy the \fB$HOME/.fehbg\fP executable file to
\fB$HOME/.config/xwwall/openbox/.fehbg\fP, making sure to preserve the
executable permissions on the copied file.
.sp
Similar procedures can be followed for respective \fIwayland\fP compositors
and \fIX11\fP window managers.
.sp
Once you have created your profile it then needs to be included in your
startup routine. You can simply append the name of the profile directory
to the \fB\-\-restore\fP option in your startup routine like so:
.sp
\fBxwwall \-\-restore openbox\fP
.sp
or whatever desired profile directory name you have used.
.SS Running from a differnt Directory
.sp
\fBxwwall\fP can be run from a different location then you HOME dir. For
this to be useful delete or rename your configuration so that the
directory where you run from is picked up.
