.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBxwwall\fP [options]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBxwwall\fP is a graphical wallpaper setter for the X Window System
often known as \fBX11\fP and \fBWayland\fP desktops for Linux and other
*nix distributions. It should run in light weight desktop environments
like Openbox, fluxbox, JWM for X11 and Labwc, Sway and others for
Wayland. It supports up to 6 monitors. It is a shell script written
in \fBbash\fP\&.
It requires \fBGtk3dialog\fP for the graphical user interface which is
a gtk+\-3.0 based UI program that describes dialog boxes from a shell
script.
In X11 it utilises \fBfeh\fP as the engine to set the wallpaper and
\fBxrandr\fP to get screen dimensions and placement of monitors.
In Wayland it uses \fBswaybg\fP to set wallpapers and \fBwlr\-randr\fP for
screen dimensions and placement.

.SH USAGE
.sp
Normally, \fBxwwall\fP is started from a menu entry without any options
although you could start it from a keyboard shortcut.
.SS Main GUI
.sp
The first thing you may see is a splash window warning you if you
have too many wallpapers and cuts off at a 250 limit and then a
window opens showing your wallpapers. Just select one and it will
open in a window; select the image by pressing it or \fBno\fP to reject.
You can also select if you want the image to strecth, center, tile or fit
your screen. If you do select \fBno\fP the program goes back to the main
window.
If you have more than 1 monitor the program cycles through those so you can
choose different back grounds for each of them.
Once done a confirmation window opens and you can either press \fByes\fP or
\fBno\fP; \fByes\fP sets your wallpaper(s) while \fBno\fP restarts the program
so you can try again.
You can exit the program safely at any stage via \fBCancel\fP or
the \fBX\fP (close) button of your window manager or compositor.
.SS Preferences
.sp
There is a \fBPreferences\fP button in the bottom left of the main window
to set the following:
.INDENT 0.0
